// Has listeners for the canvas. Perhaps implement this in Backbone?
// When the canvas gets updated:

  // Update known variables
  // Update uknonw variables
  // Ask for mandatory inputs (e.g. asking for mass when an object is created)
  // Do error checking?
  // Clear console, answer, and explanation?
